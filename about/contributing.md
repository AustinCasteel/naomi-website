Be it by being an active developer, a bug reporter, a writer or translator, or making monetary contributions, here's an overview on how you can get involved!

# Help Others

Naomi can be intimidating to new users, and even experienced ones might encounter a problem you can solve. If you are knowledgeable in Naomi or one of its related technologies, you are very much encouraged to share your insights in the [community forum](https://community.projectnaomi.com).

## Contribute Code

You might want to fix a bug, add a feature, or write a new add-on. That's awesome!

The [Developer Guide](/docs/developer) has everything to get you started.

### Report Issues

Before reporting an issue, please check the [community forum](https://community.projectnaomi.com) for solutions and help.
More people will see your issue when it is posted in the forum and community members may be able to help you find known solutions/workarounds.

But do not worry - if you are not clear, which category your issue belongs to - we will redirect you, if necessary.

Please pay attention to the respective `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in all of these repositories.
They include further details on how to report an issue or file a pull request.
